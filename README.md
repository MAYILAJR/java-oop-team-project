## 📌 **Project Overview**

A console-based Java application designed for university management.  
The system allows the management of users (students, instructors, administrators), courses, enrollments, grades, notifications, reports, authentication, and data persistence.

The project applies the fundamental principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:

- Encapsulation  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Abstraction

## 👤 **29345/2025 — User Management (Component 1)**

I worked on defining the different types of users in the system. My main focus was on modeling students, instructors, and administrators in a way that reflects their real roles within a university.

### **Overview**
Worked on implementing the core user models of the University Course Management System.

### **Work Done**
- Implemented Student, Instructor, and Admin classes  
- Extended a common User base class  
- Added role-specific attributes and behaviors  
- Overrode methods to display user information correctly  

### **Contribution Impact**
This work allows the system to clearly distinguish between different users and supports role-based features across the application.

### **OOP Principles Applied**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
